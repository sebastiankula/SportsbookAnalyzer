# Historical Sportsbook Analyzer

This project utilizes the [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) to access the betting lines for each major sportsbook worldwide, focusing on analyzing the major North American sportsbooks, such as DraftKings, BetMGM, Fanduel, Bovada, Fliff and Hard Rock Bet. With the found information, users will be able to find various lines to all sports games found in the sportsbooks. 

  - This gives users the ability to compare lines
  - Gives the ability for bettors to find the lines with the most value to secure more profit
  - Perfect for arbitrage betting

### What is arbitrage betting? 

Arbitrage betting is a strategy that involves placing bets on every possible outcome of a sporting event. 
   -  This involves taking advantage of differing opinions between all the major sportsbook lines.   
For example, a bettor can place bets on both a win or loss of the same team, at odds that ensure they make an overall profit regardless of the game outcome.
