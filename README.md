# Outclass The Odds

This project utilizes [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) to access betting lines from major sportsbooks worldwide, with a primary focus on analyzing leading North American sportsbooks, including DraftKings, BetMGM, FanDuel, Bovada, Fliff, and Hard Rock Bet. By comparing these lines, users can easily evaluate odds across different platforms for various sports games.

  - This gives users the ability to compare lines
  - Makes it easier for bettors to find the lines with the most value to secure more profit
  - Perfect for arbitrage betting

### What is arbitrage betting? 

Arbitrage betting is a strategy that involves placing bets on every possible outcome of a sporting event. 
   -  This involves taking advantage of differing opinions between all the major sportsbook lines.   
For example, a bettor can place bets on both a win or loss of the same team, at odds that ensure they make an overall profit regardless of the game outcome.
